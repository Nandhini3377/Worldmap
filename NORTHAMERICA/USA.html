    <h2>CANADA</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Canada, the second largest country in the world in area (after Russia), occupying roughly the northern two-fifths of the continent of North America.

        Despite Canada’s great size, it is one of the world’s most sparsely populated countries. <br> This fact, coupled with the grandeur of the landscape, has been central to the sense of Canadian national identity, as expressed by the Dublin-born writer Anna Brownell Jameson, who explored central Ontario in 1837 and remarked exultantly on “the seemingly interminable line of trees before you; the boundless wilderness around you; the mysterious depths amid the multitudinous foliage, where foot of man hath never penetrated…the solitude in which we proceeded mile after mile, no human being, no human dwelling within sight.” <br> Although Canadians are comparatively few in number, they have crafted what many observers consider to be a model multicultural society, welcoming immigrant populations from every other continent. <br> In addition, Canada harbours and exports a wealth of natural resources and intellectual capital equaled by few other countries. </p>

    <h3>History</h3><hr>
    <h4><B>Precontact aboriginal history</B></h4>
    <p>North America’s first humans migrated from Asia, presumably over a now-submerged land bridge from Siberia to Alaska sometime about 12,000 years ago, during the last Ice Age; it has also been argued, however, that some people arrived earlier, possibly up to 60,000 years ago. Unknown numbers of people moved southward along the western edge of the North American ice cap. The presence of the ice, which for a time virtually covered Canada, makes it reasonable to assume that the southern reaches of North America were settled before Canada, and that the Inuit who live in Canada’s Arctic regions today were the last of the aboriginal peoples to reach Canada. There is general agreement that Native American peoples are related to Asian peoples and that the closest resemblances are between North American Arctic peoples and their counterparts in Siberia.

        Although there are no written records detailing the history of Canada’s Indigenous societies prior to the first contact with Europeans, archaeological evidence and oral traditions give a reasonably complete picture of the precontact period. There were 12 major language groups among the peoples living in what is now Canada: Algonquian, Iroquoian, Siouan, Athabascan, Kootenaian, Salishan, Wakashan, Tsimshian, Haidan, Tlinglit, Inuktitut, and Beothukan. Within each language group there were usually political and cultural divisions.<br> Among the Iroquoian-speaking peoples, for example, there were two major subgroups, the Iroquois and the Huron.<br> These subgroups were further divided.<br> At the time of contact, the Iroquois had organized themselves into the Iroquois Confederacy, consisting of the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca peoples. <br> A sixth group, the Tuscarora, joined later.</p>
