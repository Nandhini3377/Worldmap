    <p style="font-style: oblique; padding-left: 10px; text-indent: 50px; text-align:justify">South America occupies the southern portion of the Americas. The continent is generally delimited on the northwest by the Darién watershed along the Colombia–Panama border, although some may consider the border instead to be the Panama Canal. Geopolitically and geographically, all of Panama – including the segment east of the Panama Canal in the isthmus – is typically included in North America alone and among the countries of Central America.Almost all of mainland South America sits on the South American Plate.</p>
